        <p id=reflection>The divide between the people and the police is a divide between minorities and police officers. On average white people have a positive or neutral position on the work of the police. In contrast black people are twice as likely to hold a more negative opinion and be less confident in the work of the police. The lack of trust doesn't come from a belief of incompetence. The both races gave the best review of the police on their ability to protect from crime. The problem and negative perception  is from feeling as though the police are lacking in their ability to hold the officers who do wrong accountable and treat racially and ethnically minority groups equally.
This lack of accountability and general respect is also why the trust in police is so varied. White  people are much more likely to have a large amount of trust in the police while black people are more likely to have little to no trust at all.
