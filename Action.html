<!--
        <p id=reflection>The divide between the people and the police is a divide between minorities and police officers.<br> On average white people have a positive or neutral position on the work of the police. In contrast <br>black people are twice as likely to hold a more negative opinion and be less confident in the work <br>of the police. The lack of trust doesn't come from a belief of incompetence. The both races gave the <br>best review of the police on their ability to protect from crime. The problem and negative perception <br> is from feeling as though the police are lacking in their ability to hold the officers who do wrong accountable <br>and treat racially and ethnically minority groups equally.
This lack of accountability and general <br>respect is also why the trust in police is so varied. White  people are much more likely to have a large amount of trust in the police <br>while black people are more likely to have little to no trust at all.
