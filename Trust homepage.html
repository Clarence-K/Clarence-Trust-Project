  <h1>Hello There </h1>
        <h3> Trust is the backbone of all healthly relationships and it can come in all shapes and size. My mission for this project is to as much as possible be able to quantitify and compare the properties of these different forms of trust</h3><br>
        
            <br>
        <p>Here are links to the current forms and conclusions Ive drawn(wip):</p>
        <ul>
        <li a href="fam.html">familial trust </li>
              <li><a href="fam.html"></a> romantic trust</li>
              <li><a href="friend.html"></a>platonic trust</li>
              <li><a href="work.html"></a>workplace trust</li>
